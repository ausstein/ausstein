# 👋 Hi, I'm Yannick Holtkamp

Physicist and computational scientist focused on integrating machine learning with classical simulations to model complex physical systems. Passionate about AI applications in physics, game environments, and complex ecosystems.

During my PhD at Constructor University Bremen, I developed a fully differentiable implementation of quantum dynamics simulation methods (NISE) in PyTorch, combining them with neural networks to improve accuracy and scalability for biologically relevant systems. I also focus on optimizing scientific codebases for high-performance computing, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces.

I'm particularly interested in applying these methods to AI-based world models, combining differentiable physical models with modern AI architectures to build systems that not only learn from data but also leverage structured knowledge from natural laws.

I go by 'ausstein' online — a playful nod to Einstein (since "aus" is the opposite of "ein" in German).

# 🧩 Projects

## Differentiable Quantum Dynamics Simulation
Built a PyTorch-based differentiable implementation of the Numerical Integration of the Schrödinger Equation (NISE), enabling integration of classical physics models with modern AI architectures.

- [TorchNISE](https://github.com/CPBPG/TorchNISE)


## 🚗 Multiprocessing for Reinforcement Learning in Trackmania
Contributed to a GitHub project focused on reinforcement learning in the racing game Trackmania. Implemented a multiprocessing system that allowed multiple agents to run separate Trackmania environments simultaneously, significantly increasing training data collection speed.

While my changes were not merged into the main repository due to internal changes by the authors, they adopted a similar approach inspired by my implementation in their internal build.

## 🎮 Game Jam Projects
Participated in 14 game jams, building complete games in C# and Unity. Many are playable in browser!
### 🕹️  [Full Game Collection](https://ldjam.com/users/ausstein/games)

Game jams have strengthened my rapid prototyping skills and creative problem-solving. 
Rather than focusing on top placement, I challenge myself with something new in every entry.
### Highlights

### 🖥️ [While loops](https://ausstein.itch.io/stuckinthewhileloop) <-- Browser Playable, click to play

Developed during Ludum Dare 47 - Theme "Stuck in a loop"

One of my favorites for tech audiences:

You are stuck in an infinite while loop, try to modify the variables to break out before the PC overheats.

> 💬 *"This game feels like the closest I’ve ever come to actually programming something. Terrifying."*

> 💬 *"Really hits home for developers!"*

> 💬 *"Perfectly captures the anxiety of debugging loops."*

> 💬 *"reallyFinalyVersion7 is the best joke of the jam. Really hits home."*

> 💬 *"while (player.enjoyedGame()) { print(“Nice game!”); } Nice game! Nice game! Nice game! Nice game! … (Player died from overheating)"*

*While Loops* received highly positive feedback at Ludum Dare 47 for its humor, creativity, and polished execution. Tech audiences especially appreciated the in-jokes and the clever use of while loops as a game mechanic.

### 🦑 [Deep Sea Mining](https://ausstein.itch.io/deep-sea-mining-post-ld) <-- Browser Playable, click to play

Developed for Ludum Dare 48 — Theme: "Deeper and Deeper"

A submarine mining game focused on exploration, upgrades, and survival. Featuring a dynamic upgrade system, procedurally increasing difficulty, and post-jam improvements based on player feedback.

> 💬  *"This is one of the few games I would sit down and play even if I wasn’t rating games for a game jam."*

> 💬  *"Great progression curve — never felt like I was grinding."*

> 💬  *"Very fun, deserves to be developed further!"*

Players praised the polished feel, addictive progression, and atmospheric graphics. I continued to improve the game after the jam, incorporating player feedback to balance combat, improve lighting, and enhance controls

  
Developed during Ludum Dare 48 - Theme "Deeper and Deeper"

Go deeper and deeper, farm crystals, upgrade your submarine and defend yourself against hostile creatures.

### 🎮 Multiplosphere (Download for Windows)

[Download link](https://files.jam.host/uploads/$372739/MULTIPLOSHPERE_POST_JAM_0.0.1.zip)

Developed for Ludum Dare 54 — Theme: "Limited Space"

A fast-paced 3D arena shooter where multiplying spheres threaten to overwhelm the player. Focused on chaotic gameplay, fast decisions, and satisfying explosions. Collect upgrades, time your moves, and survive as long as possible!

> 💬 *"Infinite replayability — would make a great time-waster on mobile!"*

> 💬 *"The spheres... they’re everywhere..."*

> 💬 *"Nice atmosphere, polished feel — well done!"*
