# üëã Hi, I'm Yannick Holtkamp

I'm a physicist and computational scientist with a passion for integrating classical simulation algorithms with machine learning techniques to advance our understanding of complex physical systems.

During my PhD at Constructor University Bremen, I developed a fully differentiable implementation of quantum dynamics simulation methods (NISE) in PyTorch, combining them with neural networks to improve accuracy and scalability for biologically relevant systems. I also focus on optimizing scientific codebases for high-performance computing, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces.

I'm particularly interested in applying these methods to AI-based world models, combining differentiable physical models with modern AI architectures to build systems that not only learn from data but also leverage structured knowledge from natural laws.

# üß© Projects

## Differentiable Quantum Dynamics Simulation
Built a PyTorch-based differentiable implementation of the Numerical Integration of the Schr√∂dinger Equation (NISE), enabling integration of classical physics models with modern AI architectures.

- [TorchNISE](https://github.com/CPBPG/TorchNISE)


## üöó Multiprocessing for Reinforcement Learning in Trackmania
Contributed to a GitHub project focused on reinforcement learning in the racing game Trackmania. Implemented a multiprocessing system that allowed multiple agents to run separate Trackmania environments simultaneously, significantly increasing training data collection speed.

While my changes were not merged into the main repository due to internal changes by the authors, they adopted a similar approach inspired by my implementation in their internal build.

- [Project Fork](https://github.com/ausstein/trackmania_rl_public)
## üéÆ Game Jam Projects
Participated in 13 game jams, building complete games in C# and Unity. Many are playable in browser!
- [Full Game Collection](https://ldjam.com/users/ausstein/games)

Game jams have strengthened my rapid prototyping skills and creative problem-solving. 
Rahter than going for the best placement, I try to challenge myself with something new for every entry.
### Highlights

### Browser Playable
- [While loops](https://ausstein.itch.io/stuckinthewhileloop)
Developed during Ludum Dare 47 - Theme "Stuck in a loop"

One of my favorites for tech audiences:

You are stuck in an infinite while loop, try to modify the variables to break out before the PC overheats.

- [Deep Sea Mining](https://ausstein.itch.io/deep-sea-mining-post-ld) ‚Äî 
Developed during Ludum Dare 48 - Theme "Deeper and Deeper"

Go deeper and deeper, farm crystals, upgrade your submarine and defend yourself against hostile creatures.

### Download for Windows
- Multiplosphere [Download link](https://files.jam.host/uploads/$372739/MULTIPLOSHPERE_POST_JAM_0.0.1.zip)
Developed during Ludum Dare 54 - Theme "Limited Space"

A 3D game. You are in a box in outer space with spheres that keep multiplying. Collect upgrates, manage the timer and shoot the spheres quickly enough so that they don't take up all the limited space in the box.
